# Lesson 12 - Advanced Functions

- Went to SuperSimpleDev's JS Practice [Website](https://supersimple.dev/projects/amazon/checkout) to practice using the console to add the prices of the items in the cart

# Function as a variable

- const function1 = function greeting(){ console.log('hello');}
- console.log(function1); will print out the greeting() function
- function1(); will run the function and produce 'hello'

- since we call the function by the variable name, we dont need the 'greeting' name for function, so we can delete and create an Anonymous Function:
- const function1 = function() {console.log('hello');} - a function without a name
- hoisting (calling a function before it's created in code), is not possible with this syntax - assigning func to a variable

- since functions are values, we can store functons in objects:
