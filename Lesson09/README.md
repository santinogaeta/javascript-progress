# Part 1 Lesson 9 - Document Object Model (DOM)

- Went to SuperSimpleDev's JS Practice [Website](https://supersimple.dev/projects/amazon/checkout) to practice using the console to add the prices of the items in the cart

# Document Objects
- document.body.innerHTML = 'Hello' - will overwrite everything in innerHTML to display 'Hello' as this controls all the HTML in the body element
- document.title = 'DOM' - will change the title of webpage to DOM

- We can have HTML elements in Javascript by using DOM by combining JS and HTML together to give JS control of the page

- when an HTML element is accessed via DOM - it converted into a Javascript object
- can also inject html elements through strings:
- document.body.innerHTML = '<button>Good Job!</button>'; - will create a button using JS

- document.querySelector() - lets us get any element from the page and put inside JS
- eg: document.querySelector
