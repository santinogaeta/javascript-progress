# Part 1 Lesson 5 - Variables

- Went to SuperSimpleDev's JS Practice [Website](https://supersimple.dev/projects/amazon/checkout) to practice using the console to add the prices of the items in the cart

# Variables

- Used to save values and assign to be referenced again later

- Used inside the <script></script> element

eg 
<script>
  let variable1 = 3;
  console.log(variable1);
</script>

 - can save values and Strings
 eg
 let message = 'hello';


# naming restrictions:
- can't use 'let' (but can use 'let1' etc)
- Can't start a variable name with a number
- cannot contain special characters (expect $ and _ , eg: let $name = 3; or let _name = 3;)

# declaring variables

- const - can't change its value later (should use const by default -safer)
- let - can be changed (use only when we know we need to change the variable)
- var - creates like let (don't use in new JS code)

- typeof [variable] - will output the type of variable is specified
