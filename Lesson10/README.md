# Part 1 Lesson 10 - HTML CSS & JS together

- Went to SuperSimpleDev's JS Practice [Website](https://supersimple.dev/projects/amazon/checkout) to practice using the console to add the prices of the items in the cart

# .classList
- adds another class label to an element
- eg document.querySelector('button').classList.add("subscribe-button") - and can add additional CSS styling to that specific button now that it's also a different class
- can also .classList.remove([class]) classes assigned to the element

# Separating code files
- to link .js file, within <srcipt> tag, link the file with the src=""
- eg <script src="[filepath].js"></script>

- to link CSS files can get rid of the <style></style> tag in the html file and within the <head></head> element,
- eg: <link rel="stylesheet" href="[filepath].css"> - link rel to describe what is being linked in, and href to tell webpage where to refer for the styling of the webpage for

- can link multiple <link> or <script></script> from multiple .js or .css files.
